1) Directly running the test_voicebank. m program can test 824 noisy speech in the Voicebank DEMAND test set one by one. To calculate the performance of enhanced results (including PESQ, CSIG, CBAK, and COVL). This program includes both the large and base versions of the proposed method (default to the large version, while the base version needs to comment out the models loaded in the large version on lines 15-19 of the program and replace them with the base version on lines 21-25).
2) After the test_voicebank.m program runs, the target clean speech and enhanced speech are saved in the sub folders (MOS_PESQ\swav and MOS_PESQ\ywav) under the MOS-PESQ folder. You can also run the Metrics.m program directly in the MOS-PESQ folder to recalculate the performance of enhanced results (including PESQ, CSIG, CBAK, and COVL) again.
3) We provide a DEMO.m program that can randomly select a noisy speech from the test set for denoising processing. Figures 1 to 3 show the noisy speech, Ground Truth, and enhanced speech, respectively.
4) Considering that the manuscript has not yet been published, this package only provides code for the enhancement and testing stages. If this study is ultimately published, we will further provide code for signal preprocessing, sample generation, and model training. And models and testing programs on other datasets.
